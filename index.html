<h3>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it differs from classic roguelikes</h3>

<ul>
  <li> player manually controls each member of his squad, though often the best
  tactics is to scout with only one character (a classic roguelike feel)
  and let others guard important areas
  <li> the game is turn-based, but with visibly high granularity --- projectiles
  fly gradually over time with varying speeds and can be sidestepped
  or shot down; less so explosions that are swarms of projectile particles
  (turn-based just the same)
  <li> time passes and factions pursue their goals on a few levels
  simultaneously, while other levels are frozen (but all are persistent)
  <li> the same laws of simulated world apply to all factions and all actors,
  whether player-controlled or AI-controlled; e.g., the same field of view
  calculation, skill checks, equipment limitations, rules for item
  and terrain use
  <li> combat mechanics is deterministic; randomness comes only from AI
  decisions and procedurally generated terrain
  <li> there's (almost) no HP regeneration; attrition ensures all past (silly)
  decisions matter; HP of every actor starts at around half max
  <li> each character has 10 uniform equipment slots, which fill quickly given
  that most melee weapons have cooldowns
  <li> each faction has a single shared inventory of unlimited size,
  which has a physical location on the map and so can be ransacked
</ul>

<em>

<blockquote>"So that was a lot of fun, but *I have no idea what's going on*."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Entertainingly, a coworker looked at my screen (I'm migrating VMs between systems while I play, lots of waiting time) and asked what UNIX tool that was. :-)"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"LOL epic. [..] current flavour of gameplay: 'Excitingly chaotic' ? :-)"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Do you think its above being a game? 'Cause its not. Its a fairly standard rogue like roguelike."</blockquote>

<a name="vision" class="anchor" href="#vision"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The lofty grandiose vision</h3>

This is not a "video game", because there is barely any "video" in it.
Neither does it aspire to be an interactive movie nor even a novel
--- you are not going to be following a script, but discovering and building
a world, a story, a grand survival strategy, a tactical toolbox of your own.
The goal is to engage you in non-verbal daydreaming about adventuring
with a band of trusted friends: you know each other so well you can almost
see through each other's eyes.
<p>

You need no more than an occasional nod, a cry of warning
or a quick gesture to fully share situational awareness,
elect a new pointman and cover his advance.
You fight as one organism, attack, escape, guard each other's back,
explore spaces no human ever saw before and experiment with and appraise
your spoils, sharing and augmenting your scarce supplies in a dark nook
of an abandoned store.
This is an adventure and a world you creatively imagine, you master,
you live through (or die in) and afterwards you tell stories about.
And even if you don't tell, this doesn't make the stories any less true.
<p>

The <a href="https://github.com/AllureOfTheStars/Allure/blob/master/GameDefinition/PLAYING.md">gameplay manual (dev version)</a>
may help when initially developing the personal game-to-brain interface pathway
that supplies game state information. The user interface tries to engage
the brain visual and aural processing centers only marginally and instead
let their full capacity be used by personal imagination for sensory
world-building in a fully original, uncoerced, true-to-dreams way.
Like when reading a book, but with less words and more action.
<p>

The game is written in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
using the <a href="http://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack">LambdaHack</a>
roguelike game engine. See the changelog file for recent improvements
and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long-term goals
are high replayability and auto-balancing through procedural
content generation and persistent content modification
based on player behaviour.
<p>

Also, developing brain implant game interfaces that bypass the visual cortex.
<p>

Also, making aliens bitterly regret the idea of plotting against Earth.
